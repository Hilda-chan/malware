- Create to hide attacker's actions on infected machine.
- Main goal of a *Rootkit* is to dissimulate himself by using *hook*.
- hook: replace a call system by another. (Example: replace listing files in a directory by listing files without showing files link to the rootkit).
- Rootkits can also stop firewall / anti-virus to not be interrupt while attacker is manipulation the infected system.
- Rootkits can also let a [[1.1.1 Backdoor]] to let the attacker connect to the machine later.
- Rootkits need high privileges to work correctly, they often are kernel diver to automatically charged during the start of the machine.
- These are hard to identify due to their location, OS can not analyse them.
- Example: TDL-4 is a rootkit installed on MBR\*.
